				Hello frens <span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>üññ</span>
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				For now, it's just me. My names <a href={'https://twitter.com/frompy_'} className={`${classes.link} ${lightMode ? classes.link_night : ''}`}> Frompy </a>and I'm a web developer and kind of an artist? Idk. What my code produces is my art,
				but you could say that about anything really. So maybe i'm not, who knows?
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				But anyway,
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				I became hooked by the internet as a 5 year old kid sometime around
				1997 when my dad first showed me his new computer - A machine
				running Windows 95' and the revolutionary new web browser: Internet
				Explorer. It was incredible.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				At this point the world wide web was just a year older than I was. And man, have things changed in that time. Now more than ever.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				About a year ago I read an <a href={'https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/'} className={`${classes.link} ${lightMode ? classes.link_night : ''}`}> article </a> referencing Kevin Kelly's (also my grandads name, oddly) idea of "A Thousand True Fans".
				And since then, I've not been able to stop thinking about it.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				It's such a powerful concept and the inspiration behind pxplots -
				To support artists in this new digital landscape.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				Like so many of you, I'm ridiculously excited for what the future holds for web3 and I truly hope pxplots can become an integral part of it.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				Thankyou for reading. Your time is greatly appreciated <span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>üôè</span>
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				Peace, love & gm's
			</p>
