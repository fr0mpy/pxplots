				As you've read, the plans for pxplots are pretty big - To achieve the overall idea, whilst delivering a product as soon as possible,
				the roadmap is split into multiple milestones to manage.
			</p>

			<p className={classes.text}>
				Firstly, for every 1000 pxplots that are minted (after the initial free 1000) There will be a giveaway of 1eth each to 3 pxplot holders.
			</p>

			<p className={classes.text}>
				Following the mint: discussions with the community, artists & consultants in the web3 space will take place to produce a full white paper and project plan.
			</p>

			<p className={classes.text}>
				Positions for mods and social managers will open also.
			</p>

			<p className={classes.text}>
				From here pxplots can start expanding the team further - looking to onboard for dev and design roles.
			</p>

			<p className={classes.text}>
				Once the team and project plan are aligned, we can begin developing the product and iterate over it as necessary
				- allowing us to create an MVP as soon as possible, and continuously improve it.
			</p>

			<p className={classes.text}>
				A detailed insight will be provided in the whitepaper.
			</p>
