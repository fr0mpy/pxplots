                If you're looking for a new pfp or chasing rares, then a pxplot probably isn't right for you. There's many more aesthetically pleasing NFT's, with cool traits out there.

                A customisable market page for NFT artists to personalise, and then sell, mint or link their work from. Without having to code anything themselves.
