				This, is a pxplot.

			<p className={classes.text} style={{ marginBottom: '24px' }}>
				...Yep, that's it.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				If you're looking for a new pfp or chasing rares, then a pxplot probably isn't right for you. There's many more aesthetically pleasing NFT's, with cool traits out there.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				On the other hand: If you're an artist looking to build your platform & brand, or just someone interested real utility, then maybe investing in a humble coloured cube will be of interest.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				Minting a pxplot will help fund this project and it's overall goal where each pxplot will unlock it's own independent market page on the pxplot website, owned by the NFT holder.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				A customisable market page for NFT artists to personalise, and then sell, mint or link their work from. Without having to code anything themselves.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				Imagine LooksRare/Opensea crossed with SquareSpace.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				{checkOutExamplesText()}

			<p className={classes.text}>üí≠</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				The idea is that you'll have your own page e.g. pxplots.xyz/yourname - which will come with a range of pre made theme layouts to choose from, or you'll be able to create your own.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				And from this page, you can introduce yourself, your art and grow your fan base.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				Whether you're selling images, videos or music, you'll keep 97% of the sale - With 1% going back into maintaining pxplots and the remaining 2% being split between all pxplot holders.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				You'll be able to authenticate yourself and access your plot, by holding your pxplot in your wallet. Like a key.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				<span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>üóùÔ∏è</span>
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				And if you wish to, you can sell your plot onwards. With the page being wiped on transfer and the new holder being able to again customise the page however they wish to.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				The first 1000 plots will be free to mint - with the remaining 9,000 costing 0.06eth per plot.
			</p>
			<p className={classes.text}>
				Check out the RoadMap / FAQ for more info. Or, drop a message on Twitter (our Discord will be open soon, we'll update this page and our twitter when it is).

			<p className={classes.text}>
				Thank you for reading.
